                <h2>Scuba life</h2>
                <p>We must explain what scuba diving is to you because our company name contains the word "Scooba."
                    The answer to the question, "So what is scuba diving?" is that it is a type of underwater diving in which divers employ breathing apparatus that is entirely dependant on a surface air supply and has a finite but changeable endurance. 
                    Christian J. Lambertsen came up with the word "scuba" in a 1952 patent application, which stands for "Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus".</p>
                   <P>So, Scooba Life is a business that provides underwater scuba diving with all the necessary safety gear. We presently provide our services in one nation, which is <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mombasa/@-4.0351767,39.5261763,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x184012e78ec02c7d:0xcb618bbc35d0db5a!8m2!3d-4.0434771!4d39.6682065!16zL20vMDFjZmQz?entry=ttu">Mombasa-Kenya</a> this is due to the fact that we only opened last year ; as a result, we will supply the trip tickets.</P>

                <h2>History of scuba diving and Scooba Life</h2>
                <p>Scuba diving history and the history of scuba gear are intertwined. 
                    By the turn of the 20th century, two fundamental designs for underwater breathing equipment had been developed: closed-circuit breathing equipment, which filters the diver's carbon dioxide from exhaled unused oxygen before being recirculated, and open-circuit surface-supplied equipment, which vents the diver's exhaled gas directly into the water when necessary. 
                    In the lack of dependable, transportable, and affordable high-pressure gas storage tanks, closed circuit equipment was more readily converted to diving.</p>
                    <P>Scooba Life is a business that Harshvir Singh Ahuja founded in 2021 July. The company currently operates in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mombasa/@-4.0351767,39.5261763,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x184012e78ec02c7d:0xcb618bbc35d0db5a!8m2!3d-4.0434771!4d39.6682065!16zL20vMDFjZmQz?entry=ttu">Mombasa-Kenya</a> but we are currently trying to open our branches in other countries like India, the UK, and the US. Our main goal is to encourage people to explore the majestic waters of the earth. </P>
