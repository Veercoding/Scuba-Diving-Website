                <h2>Rebreather</h2>
                <p>A rebreather allows the person to re-breath some of the carbon dioxide, which acts as a way to stimulate breathing.</p>
                <p>Less common are closed circuit (CCR) and semi-closed (SCR) rebreathers which, unlike open-circuit sets that vent off all exhaled gases, process all or part of each exhaled breath for re-use by removing the carbon dioxide and replacing the oxygen used by the diver.
                    Rebreathers release few or no gas bubbles into the water, and use much less stored gas volume, for an equivalent depth and time because exhaled oxygen is recovered; this has advantages for research, military, photography, and other applications. 
                    Rebreathers are more complex and more expensive than open-circuit scuba, and special training and correct maintenance are required for them to be safely used, due to the larger variety of potential failure modes.

                    In a closed-circuit rebreather the oxygen partial pressure in the rebreather is controlled, so it can be maintained at a safe continuous maximum, which reduces the inert gas (nitrogen and/or helium) partial pressure in the breathing loop. 
                    Minimising the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues for a given dive profile reduces the decompression obligation. 
                    This requires continuous monitoring of actual partial pressures with time and for maximum effectiveness requires real-time computer processing by the diver's decompression computer. 
                    Decompression can be much reduced compared to fixed ratio gas mixes used in other scuba systems and, as a result, divers can stay down longer or require less time to decompress.
                     A semi-closed circuit rebreather injects a constant mass flow of a fixed breathing gas mixture into the breathing loop, or replaces a specific percentage of the respired volume, so the partial pressure of oxygen at any time during the dive depends on the diver's oxygen consumption and/or breathing rate. 
                     Planning decompression requirements requires a more conservative approach for a SCR than for a CCR, but decompression computers with a real-time oxygen partial pressure input can optimise decompression for these systems. 
                     Because rebreathers produce very few bubbles, they do not disturb marine life or make a diver's presence known at the surface; this is useful for underwater photography, and for covert work.</p>

                <h2>Safety equipment</h2>
                <p>We provide the following safety equipment.</p>
                <p>A bailout cylinder provides emergency breathing gas sufficient for a safe emergency ascent.
                     Any scuba diver who will be diving below a depth from which they are competent to do a safe emergency swimming ascent should ensure that they have an alternative breathing gas supply available at all times in case of a failure of the equipment they are breathing from at the time. 
                     Several systems are in common use depending on the planned dive profile. Most common, but least reliable, is relying on the dive buddy for gas sharing using a secondary second stage, commonly called an octopus regulator connected to the primary first stage. 
                     This system relies entirely on the dive buddy being immediately available to provide emergency gas. More reliable systems require the diver to carry an alternative gas supply sufficient to allow the diver to safely reach a place where more breathing gas is available. 
                     For open water recreational divers this is the surface. For technical divers it may be a stage cylinder positioned at a point on the exit path. An emergency gas supply must be sufficiently safe to breathe at any point on the planned dive profile at which it may be needed. 
                     This equipment may be a bailout cylinder, a bailout rebreather, a travel gas cylinder, or a decompression gas cylinder. 
                     When using a travel gas or decompression gas, the back gas (main gas supply) may be the designated emergency gas supply.
                    Cutting tools such as knives, line cutters or shears are often carried by divers to cut loose from entanglement in nets or lines. 
                    A surface marker buoy (SMB) on a line held by the diver indicates the position of the diver to the surface personnel. 
                    This may be an inflatable marker deployed by the diver at the end of the dive, or a sealed float, towed for the whole dive. 
                    A surface marker also allows easy and accurate control of ascent rate and stop depth for safer decompression.
                     Various surface detection aids may be carried to help surface personnel spot the diver after ascent. In addition to the surface marker buoy, divers may carry mirrors, lights, strobes, whistles, flares or emergency locator beacons.</p>
