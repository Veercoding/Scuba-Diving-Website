                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The PADI Scuba Diver course is a sub-rating of the PADI Open Water Diver course, which is one of the most popular entry-level scuba diving courses in the world.
                If you are unsure about diving and want to take each certification step by step, or always want to dive under the supervision of a PADI pro 
                    ,then the PADI Scuba Diver rating might be for you. It qualifies you have to dive to 12m deep under supervision in conditions similar or better.
                    The PADI Scuba Diver rating can be completed over a couple of days when done with the PADI eLearning option.You will spend a few hours in the pool
                    getting comfortable with your dive skills then the 2 ocean dives are completed in one day on the boat. And what better place to learn than Kenya? From the dive base in Diani, 
                    we have sheltered dive sites which are perfect for allowing beginners to get comfortable in the water and complete the skill training as well as a chance to take in the wonders of the 
                    thousands of different marine species on the coral reefs and exciting local dive sites such as wrecks.
                    The course is broken down into three segments, the knowledge development, confined water (in a swimming pool) training and open water dives.</p>

                <h2>eLearning</h2>
                <P>Completing the knowledge development section, starts before you begin the course and requires you to complete most of the<a href="https://shop.padi.com/"> PADI Online learning</a> for the PADI Open Water Diver Course. 
                    This can be accessed via the<a href="https://shop.padi.com/"> PADI Library app </a> or via the PADI website.

            <h2>Pool Training</h2>
            <p>Right now we are getting wet. 
                This is the reason you are here.
                 Our confined water training for the PADI Scuba Diver course is conducted in the swimming pool at the dive base where the course is being held.
                The pool session teaches you to use SCUBA safely and procedures to troubleshoot any problems you potentially might have. 
                The swimming pool environment allows you a safe area to practice with no outside factors to worry about such as poor visibility, surge or current.
                This is about making sure you are comfortable using the scuba unit so our Instructors will make sure you have ample time to practice skills and perform them with ease before moving on to the next section of the course.</p>

            <h2>Ocean Dives</h2>
            <p> On the last day of the course you go diving for real . We will go by boat out to a local reef which is suitable for conducting the training.
                Before the "tour" portion of each dive, when you get to see the wonders of the marine life in the Indian Ocean and practice your own diving techniques in this "weightless" environment, 
                a brief portion of each dive is spent repeating some of the skills you mastered in the swimming pool.
                If you have completed all other course performance requirements and have completed 2 dives, you will be a fully qualified PADI Scuba Diver.</p>

            <h2>Dive Sites</h2>
<p>After completing the pool training for our PADI Scuba Diver courses, we give you a choice of open water locations to conduct your ocean dives.
    The first option leaves from one of our dive bases in Diani and travels to one or two nearby coral reef dive sites, with a maximum depth of 12 meters. 
    These locations typically last a half-day and contain a wide variety of marine life, including the turtles for which Diani is famed.
    We have the option of spending the entire day outside at the Kisite National Marine Park, where there is a strong chance of swimming with wild dolphins. 
    This full-day excursion includes transportation by dhow or boat to the dive site, lunch on board and marine park admission fees.
     We transfer you from Diani to Shimoni, where the boat departs from.</p>
