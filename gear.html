                <h2>Scuba diving equipment</h2>
                <p>Scuba diving equipment, also known as scuba gear , is the equipment used by a scuba diver for the purpose of diving and includes the 
                    breathing apparatus , diving suit buoyancy control and weighting systems, fins for mobility, 
                    mask for improving underwater vision, and a variety of safety equipment and other accessories.</p>

                <h2>Breathing apparatus</h2>
                <p>In scuba life we offer Breathing apparatus, the main purpose of this gear is to allow the diver to breathe while diving, and is transported by the diver. 
                    It is also commonly referred to as the scuba set.</p>
                  <p>Most recreational scuba diving is done using a half mask which covers the diver's eyes and nose, and a mouthpiece to supply the breathing gas from the demand valve or rebreather. 
                    Inhaling from a regulator's mouthpiece becomes second nature very quickly. The other common arrangement is a full face mask which covers the eyes, nose and mouth, and often allows the diver to breathe through the nose. 
                    Professional scuba divers are more likely to use full face masks, which protect the diver's airway if the diver loses consciousness, therefore in scuba life we provide both types of masks.</p>

                <h2>Open-circuit</h2>
                <p>Open circuit scuba has no provision for using the breathing gas more than once for respiration.
                    The gas inhaled from the scuba equipment is exhaled to the environment, or occasionally into another item of equipment for a special purpose, usually to increase the buoyancy of a lifting device such as a buoyancy compensator, inflatable surface marker buoy or small lifting bag. 
                    The breathing gas is generally provided from a high-pressure diving cylinder through a scuba regulator. 
                    By always providing the appropriate breathing gas at ambient pressure, demand valve regulators ensure the diver can inhale and exhale naturally and without excessive effort, regardless of depth, as and when needed.</p>
                    <P>The most commonly used scuba set uses a "single-hose" open circuit 2-stage demand regulator, connected to a single back-mounted high-pressure gas cylinder, with the first stage connected to the cylinder valve and the second stage at the mouthpiece.
                        This arrangement differs from Émile Gagnan's and Jacques Cousteau's original 1942 "twin-hose" design, known as the Aqua-lung, in which the cylinder pressure was reduced to ambient pressure in one or two stages which were all in the housing mounted to the cylinder valve or manifold.
                        The "single-hose" system has significant advantages over the original system for most applications.Hence scuba life provides a single-hose , becuase ii is the best for our safety</P>

                <h2>Wetsuit and Drysuit</h2>
                <p>In scuba life we offer Wetsuit and Drysuit, the main purpose of this gear is that it provides Protection from heat loss in cold water  which  is usually provided by wetsuits or dry suits. 
                    These also provide protection from sunburn, abrasion and stings from some marine organisms. 
                    Where thermal insulation is not important, lycra suits/diving skins may be sufficient</p>
                  <p>A wetsuit is a garment, usually made of foamed neoprene, which provides thermal insulation, abrasion resistance and buoyancy. 
                    The insulation properties depend on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material, which reduce its ability to conduct heat.
                     The bubbles also give the wetsuit a low density, providing buoyancy in water. Suits range from a thin (2 mm or less) "shortie", covering just the torso, to a full 8 mm semi-dry, usually complemented by neoprene boots, gloves and hood. 
                     A good close fit and few zips help the suit to remain waterproof and reduce flushing – the replacement of water trapped between suit and body by cold water from the outside. 
                     Improved seals at the neck, wrists and ankles and baffles under the entry zip produce a suit known as "semi-dry".

                    A dry suit also provides thermal insulation to the wearer while immersed in water,and normally protects the whole body except the head, hands, and sometimes the feet. 
                    In some configurations, these are also covered. Dry suits are usually used where the water temperature is below 15 °C (60 °F) or for extended immersion in water above 15 °C (60 °F), where a wetsuit user would get cold, and with an integral helmet, boots, and gloves for personal protection when diving in contaminated water.
                    Dry suits are designed to prevent water from entering. 
                    This generally allows better insulation making them more suitable for use in cold water. 
                    They can be uncomfortably hot in warm or hot air, and are typically more expensive and more complex to don. 
                    For divers, they add some degree of complexity as the suit must be inflated and deflated with changes in depth in order to avoid "squeeze" on descent or uncontrolled rapid ascent due to over-buoyancy. 
                    Dry suit divers may also use the gas argon to inflate their suits via low pressure inflator hose. 
                    This is because the gas is inert and has a low thermal conductivity</p>
